        Alphonse Mucha is an early illustrator who brought art to the mainstream
        masses. Through his work in advertising he became a seminal figure in
        the Art Nouveau movement. The Mucha Woman in Job has become an icon.
        'JOB' being a trademark of the Joseph Bardou Company, they produced
        boxes of cigarette papers. The poster was printed to a variety of
        international markets. Similar to the likes of Calvin Klein today, the
        poster was a marketing staple of the time. This specific work is one of
        Alphonse Mucha's most famous. It is often pointed to as one of the key
        works of the Art Nouveau movement.

        Art up to this point was limited to architecture, museums, and religious
        buildings. The Art Nouveau movement, which Alphonse Mucha is famously a
        part of, democratized art. The idea of woman at the time smoking was
        considered a faux pas. Alphonse Mucha's Job, any many others of his
        works, used sexuality and provocation to promote the subject of his
        works. In this case being cigarette papers. He balanced it with tones of
        gold and the mosaic-like border to exude a sense of elegance. It gives
        the sense that Job cigarette papers were something for the wealthy and
        secret. The poster presented an almost scandalous presence to the
        product. Consumers should feel exuded with elegance when consuming Job
        cigarette papers.

        The democratization of art would continue. Art should be in the hands of
        the people elevating and delighting every day life. This is the crux of
        the Art Nouveau movement.
